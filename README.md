This repository holds source code and other resources related to my work and ideas I am willing to share openly/ publicly.

#personal information
I am David Bamutura, a two time SIDA (2015& 2016-2020) and one tme University of Kent's School of Computing Scholar. I am a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science, Mbarara University of Science and Technology. I am also  Doctoral student at Chalmers University of Technology's Department of Computer Sceicne and Engineering in Gothenburg Sweden. As a doctoral student, I am attached to the Functional Programming Division (Research Group). 

## **Reseach Interests**
My currrent research interests are in the areas of Compuational Linguistics / Natural Language Processing / Human Language Technologies. I am working on computational language resources for under-resourced indegenous languages of Uganda specifically Runyankore-Rukiga personally and collaboratively working with masters students on Luganda, Runyoro-Rutoro and Lusoga. We intend to also develop software applications using the grammar resources we develop and hope the applications are useful for Ugandan native speakers of those languages and those willing to learn the languages. I am also interested in Big Data/Data Science and its applications in Natural Language Processing. 

## **Other projects**
In my spare time, I work on projects related to Functional Programming for example I am learning about Computational Semantics with Functional Programming and Embedded Systems and Software Engineering. I enjoy playing with electronics and small computers such as Arduino Starter Kit and the rapberry-pi, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Memory Management.
